      Intelligent Transportation System.

1).In this system we will try to manage the transportation system of the city i.e. xyz city and try to channelise the traffic in a route where less traffic is present 
2). Hence try to help people to reach the nearest bus stops from where they can catch the bus for their journey.




Benefits:-
1.)We will be able to channelise the traffic in a better way and in a right way.
2.)A Person who wants to catch the bus for a particular journey and if the route of the particular journey is having traffic and the route for the journey for the bus has been changed and now which bus stop should the person move so that it can catch the bus.
3.)Moving to the nearest bus stop of the bus route will help him to save time,save money and If the particular person instead of moving to the Main Bus stand moves to the nearest bus stop for catching the bus then this will result to less traffic near the Bus Stand area and hence it will result to less air and noise pollution for the environment.
4).By using the present data of the traffic areas we will try people not to move in that direction and hence less movement of vehicles in the same traffic area will help to sort the traffic.
